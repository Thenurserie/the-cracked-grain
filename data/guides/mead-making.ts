      title: "Introduction to Mead",
      content: `
Mead is honey wine—one of humanity's oldest alcoholic beverages, predating both beer and grape wine by millennia. Archaeological evidence suggests mead production dates back over 9,000 years, with ancient cultures from Vikings to Ethiopians to Chinese all crafting their own versions of fermented honey. The simplicity of mead's core ingredients—honey, water, and yeast—belies the incredible complexity and depth of flavor a well-made mead can achieve.

The history of mead is woven into mythology and legend. Norse warriors believed mead granted them strength and wisdom. The term "honeymoon" comes from the medieval tradition of drinking honey wine for a full moon cycle after marriage. Ancient Greeks called it the "nectar of the gods." Despite this rich history, mead fell into obscurity for centuries, overshadowed by beer and wine. Today, it's experiencing a remarkable renaissance as homebrewers and craft meaderies rediscover this ancient drink.

Why make mead at home? Beyond the satisfaction of crafting an ancient beverage, mead offers unique advantages. It's naturally gluten-free. It showcases local honey in a way nothing else can—a wildflower honey from your region creates a mead that tastes distinctly of your home. The variety is staggering: traditional mead, fruit meads (melomels), spiced meads (metheglins), apple meads (cysers), and countless other variations. You can make session-strength hydromel at 5% ABV or powerful sack meads exceeding 18% ABV. Dry, semi-sweet, or dessert-sweet—you control it all.

Mead differs fundamentally from both wine and beer. Unlike beer, mead involves no grain, no mashing, no sparging, and no hop additions (usually). Unlike wine, honey lacks the nutrients yeast need, requiring deliberate nutrient additions throughout fermentation. Mead typically requires less equipment than beer brewing but demands more patience than either beer or wine. Where beer is ready in 2-4 weeks and wine in 2-6 months, mead often needs 6-12 months minimum, with some styles improving for years.

Set realistic time expectations: mead making is not a quick hobby. You'll mix your must (honey, water, yeast) in a single afternoon, but fermentation takes 4-8 weeks, followed by bulk aging of 6-12+ months. A traditional mead started today won't reach peak drinkability for a year. This isn't a flaw—it's the nature of mead. The wait rewards you with complexity, smoothness, and depth impossible to achieve quickly. Many meadmakers start multiple batches staggered over time, so there's always mead ready or nearly ready.

Cost considerations center on honey. While equipment costs match winemaking ($150-300 for a complete setup), honey is expensive—$15-40 for a 5-pound container depending on variety and quality. A typical 5-gallon batch of traditional mead uses 12-18 pounds of honey ($36-108), working out to $1.20-3.60 per bottle. Melomels with added fruit cost more. However, the final product often rivals $20-40 commercial meads, making the investment worthwhile. Plus, buying honey in bulk or from local beekeepers can significantly reduce costs.

      title: "Types of Mead",
      content: `
The world of mead is remarkably diverse. Understanding the major categories helps you choose what to make first and sparks ideas for future batches.

**Traditional Mead (Show Mead)**: Honey, water, and yeast. That's it. No fruit, no spices, no adjuncts. This is the purest expression of honey's character. A well-made traditional mead showcases the honey variety beautifully—orange blossom honey creates entirely different mead than buckwheat honey. Traditional meads are also the most challenging because there's nowhere to hide flaws. Start here to learn the fundamentals, or save it for when you've mastered nutrient management and fermentation control.

**Melomel**: Mead made with fruit. This is the most popular category for beginners and experienced makers alike. Berry melomels (blackberry, raspberry, blueberry) are crowd-pleasers. Stone fruit melomels (peach, cherry, plum) offer incredible aromatics. The fruit adds complexity, acidity to balance sweetness, and beautiful color. Melomels are more forgiving than traditionals because fruit contributes its own character. A mediocre honey can shine when paired with complementary fruit.

**Metheglin**: Mead with spices or herbs. Traditional examples include cinnamon and clove (holiday mead), vanilla and oak (bourbon barrel character), or lavender and chamomile (floral elegance). Metheglins allow creative expression—think chai spices, pumpkin pie spices, hot pepper, coffee, chocolate, or herbal blends. The key is balance: too much spice overwhelms the honey.

**Cyser**: Mead made with apple juice instead of water. Essentially a cross between mead and hard cider. Cysers ferment faster than traditional meads due to the nutrients in apple juice, and they're approachable for cider drinkers. Variations include adding cinnamon/nutmeg for apple pie cyser or using different apple varieties for unique profiles. Cysers age well and make excellent holiday gifts.

**Pyment**: Mead made with grape juice. A honey-sweetened wine, essentially. Pyments can use red grapes (creating rich, tannic meads), white grapes (crisp, refreshing meads), or even wine-making grape juice concentrates. These combine the best of mead and wine—honey complexity with grape structure and tannin.

**Braggot**: The bridge between mead and beer. Braggots contain both honey and malted grain, hopped or unhopped. Historical braggots were significant parts of medieval drinking culture. Modern braggots range from honey-sweetened pale ales to spiced honey barleywines. They require brewing equipment (for mashing grain) but offer unique flavor profiles impossible to achieve with pure mead or pure beer.

**Bochet**: Mead made with caramelized honey. Before adding water, you carefully heat honey to caramelize the sugars, developing toffee, caramel, marshmallow, and toasted notes. Bochets are dark, rich, and complex, with flavor profiles unlike any other mead. The caramelization process is tricky (honey can burn), but the results are spectacular. Bochet is an advanced technique—master traditional mead first.

**Hydromel**: Session mead with lower alcohol (3.5-7.5% ABV). Made with less honey, hydromels ferment quickly and are ready to drink in 2-4 months. They're refreshing, light, and perfect for summer. Think of hydromel as the "table wine" of mead—easy-drinking, affordable, and approachable.

**Sack Mead**: High-alcohol, sweet mead (14-20% ABV). Made with large amounts of honey (4+ pounds per gallon), sack meads are dessert drinks—sip slowly, savor the complexity. They require high-alcohol-tolerant yeast, extended aging (1-3+ years), and patience. A well-aged sack mead rivals the finest dessert wines.

      title: "Equipment You'll Need",
      content: `
Mead making shares most equipment with winemaking. If you've made wine, you already own everything you need. If you're new to fermentation, here's what to acquire:

**Primary Fermenter**: A 6-7.5 gallon food-grade plastic bucket or glass carboy. Some meadmakers ferment entirely in carboys; others use buckets for primary (easier for adding nutrients and stirring) then rack to carboys for aging. Buckets are cheaper and lighter but allow minimal oxygen permeation over long aging periods. Glass carboys are heavier and breakable but perfect for long-term aging.

**Secondary Fermenter**: One or more 5-6 gallon glass or PET carboys. You'll rack from primary to secondary, and possibly to tertiary. Having multiple carboys lets you stagger batches and keep mead aging while starting new projects. Glass is traditional and impermeable; PET plastic (Better Bottle brand) is lighter and safer but has slight oxygen permeability over months.

**Airlocks and Bungs**: Essential for one-way gas exchange. S-locks and 3-piece airlocks both work. Fill with sanitizer solution, vodka, or boiled water. Make sure bungs fit your fermenters—size matters, and a poor fit leads to airlock failure.

**Hydrometer and Test Jar**: Your most critical tool. Mead making requires precise gravity tracking to calculate residual sweetness, alcohol content, and fermentation progress. A test jar (at least 12 inches tall) allows safe sampling. Learn to use your hydrometer accurately—mead success depends on it.

**Auto-Siphon and Tubing**: For racking mead between vessels without disturbing sediment or introducing oxygen. Get 5/16" or 3/8" food-grade tubing, at least 6 feet. An auto-siphon makes the process foolproof.

**Bottles**: Standard 750ml wine bottles work perfectly. You'll need about 25-30 bottles per 5-6 gallon batch. Cork or cap them depending on your equipment and preference. Some meadmakers use swing-top bottles (Grolsch style) for convenience.

**Corks and Corker**: Natural corks, synthetic corks, or Nomacorc. A floor corker makes bottling significantly easier than a hand corker, especially for multiple batches.

**Sanitizer**: Star San is the gold standard—no-rinse, effective, pH-based. One bottle lasts years. Alternatively, potassium metabisulfite (Campden tablets) works but requires rinsing.

**Large Pot**: For warming water and mixing must. A 3-5 gallon stainless steel pot is ideal. You don't need to boil anything (in fact, you shouldn't boil honey), but warming water speeds honey dissolution.

**Thermometer**: To ensure water is appropriate temperature before pitching yeast (generally 65-75°F for ale yeasts).

**Optional but Useful**: A pH meter helps balance acidity, crucial for some meads. A refractometer provides quick gravity readings with tiny samples (though it requires correction formulas after fermentation begins). A wine thief pulls samples without opening your airlock. Degassing wand (drill attachment) removes CO2 efficiently.

The total investment runs $150-300 for a complete beginner setup, less if you find used equipment or start with buckets instead of glass.

      title: "Understanding Mead Ingredients",
      content: `
Mead's simplicity is deceptive. Four ingredients—honey, water, yeast, and nutrients—combine to create infinite variety.

**HONEY: The Foundation**

Honey IS mead. Your honey choice defines your mead's character more than any other decision. Different honey varieties produce dramatically different meads:

**Wildflower**: The most common and versatile. Flavor varies by region and season but generally offers balanced floral, herbal, and fruity notes. Excellent for beginners and traditional meads.

**Clover**: Mild, clean, slightly sweet with minimal distinct character. Perfect for melomels where you want honey sweetness without competing with fruit flavors. Very approachable and affordable.

**Orange Blossom**: Bright citrus notes, floral aroma, light and delicate. Makes outstanding traditional meads and pairs beautifully with berries or stone fruit.

**Buckwheat**: Dark, robust, molasses-like with earthy, malty character. Polarizing—people love it or hate it. Excellent in braggots or spiced metheglins where boldness is desired.

**Meadowfoam**: Delicate vanilla and marshmallow notes. Subtle, elegant, and expensive. Produces incredibly smooth traditional meads with silky mouthfeel.

Others worth exploring: Raspberry (intense berry character), Tupelo (complex, fruity, prized), Sourwood (anise notes), Buckwheat (robust), Manuka (medicinal, herbal).

**Raw vs Pasteurized**: Raw honey contains natural yeasts and enzymes. Some believe these add complexity; others worry about contamination. Commercial honey is typically pasteurized (heat-treated) to prevent crystallization and kill wild yeast. For mead, either works fine—you're adding your own yeast anyway. Raw honey may offer slightly more complex aromatics.

**How Much Honey?** Typical ranges per gallon of finished mead:
- Hydromel (session mead): 1.5-2.5 lbs → OG 1.035-1.070 → 3.5-7% ABV
- Standard mead: 2.5-3.5 lbs → OG 1.070-1.110 → 9-14% ABV
- Sack mead: 4-6+ lbs → OG 1.110-1.150+ → 14-20% ABV

Use a mead calculator to determine exact amounts for your target gravity and final sweetness.

**Quality Matters**: Cheap grocery store honey often tastes bland or cooked. Local honey from beekeepers or farmer's markets typically offers superior flavor at competitive prices. Bulk honey (5-gallon buckets) from homebrew shops provides best value for serious meadmakers.

**WATER: The Canvas**

Spring water is ideal—minerals add character without chlorine or chloramine that create off-flavors. Distilled water works but lacks mineral complexity. Tap water is risky: chlorine creates medicinal phenols, and chloramine (not removed by boiling) requires Campden tablet treatment. If your tap water tastes good, it's probably fine, but spring water is cheap insurance.

**YEAST: The Workhorse**

Never use bread yeast for mead. Wine yeast strains are engineered for high-alcohol tolerance, clean fermentation, and predictable results.

**Lalvin 71B-1122**: The beginner's favorite. Moderate alcohol tolerance (14%), fruity esters, smooth finish, and unique ability to metabolize malic acid (softens tart fruit in melomels). Great for semi-sweet meads and fruit meads. Ferments at 59-86°F.

**Lalvin D47**: Produces full-bodied meads with tropical fruit esters. Moderate alcohol tolerance (15%), temperature-sensitive (requires 59-68°F—warmer temps create fusel alcohols). Excellent for traditional meads and melomels where you want complexity.

**Lalvin K1-V1116**: Dry, neutral, vigorous, and high alcohol tolerance (18%). Ferments clean at wide temperature range (50-95°F). Perfect for dry meads, high-gravity sack meads, or when you want honey to shine without yeast character.

**Lalvin EC-1118**: Champagne yeast. Extremely vigorous, high alcohol tolerance (18%), ferments everything dry, works at cold temperatures. Use when you want bone-dry mead or need bulletproof fermentation. Can strip delicate honey character with its aggressiveness.

**Red Star Premier Cuvee (Pasteur Red)**: Classic mead yeast. Moderate alcohol tolerance (13-15%), enhances honey character, reliable. Good all-around choice.

Match yeast to desired outcome: fruity/sweet = 71B or D47; dry/neutral = K1-V1116 or EC-1118.

**YEAST NUTRIENTS: THE CRITICAL COMPONENT**

This cannot be overstated: **honey lacks the nitrogen, vitamins, and minerals yeast need to ferment healthily**. Without nutrients, you'll experience stuck fermentation, hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell), fusel alcohols (harsh, hot), and months-long fermentation times. Nutrients are not optional—they're mandatory.

**Go-Ferm**: Rehydration nutrient. Mix with warm water when rehydrating dry yeast. Prepares yeast cells for the stressful fermentation environment. Use 1.25g per gram of yeast.

**Fermaid-O**: Organic nutrient blend (dead yeast cells, vitamins). Gentle, effective, minimal off-flavor risk. Preferred by many meadmakers. Typical total dose: 2-3g per gallon across multiple additions.

**Fermaid-K**: Inorganic nutrient with DAP, vitamins, and minerals. Highly effective but can create harsh character if overdosed. Use sparingly. Total dose: 1-1.5g per gallon.

**DAP (Diammonium Phosphate)**: Pure inorganic nitrogen. Fast-acting, cheap, but one-dimensional. Can create harsh flavors if used alone. Best combined with organic nutrients.

**Staggered Nutrient Additions (SNA)**: Adding all nutrients at once overwhelms yeast and can create off-flavors. Instead, add nutrients in stages:
- Day 1 (pitch): Go-Ferm during rehydration
- Day 2 (24hr): First nutrient addition (¼ of total)
- Day 4: Second addition (¼ of total)
- Day 7 or at 1/3 sugar break: Third addition (¼ of total)
- Day 10 or at 2/3 sugar break: Final addition (¼ of total)

**TOSNA Protocol** (Tailored Organic Staggered Nutrient Addition): Advanced method using only organic nutrients, no DAP. Calculate exact nutrient needs based on starting gravity. Produces incredibly clean meads. More complex but worth learning.

Bottom line: budget for nutrients ($15-25 for starter pack), follow a schedule religiously, and your mead will ferment clean and finish strong.

      id: "sanitation",
      title: "Sanitation",
      content: `
Mead's high sugar content makes it vulnerable to contamination. Bacteria and wild yeast will happily feast on your expensive honey if given opportunity. Rigorous sanitation is non-negotiable.

Cleaning and sanitizing are distinct steps. Cleaning removes organic material, dirt, and residue with detergents like PBW (Powdered Brewery Wash) or unscented OxiClean. Sanitizing kills microorganisms using chemical sanitizers. Always clean first, then sanitize.

**Star San** is the gold standard for meadmakers. Mix 1 oz per 5 gallons water, creating acidic sanitizing solution. Contact time is 30 seconds. It's no-rinse—remaining foam is harmless and actually beneficial (provides slight acidity). One bottle lasts years. Mix a batch at the start of mead day and use it for everything.

**Potassium Metabisulfite** (Campden tablets) also works. Crush 2-3 tablets per gallon of water for sanitizing solution. Unlike Star San, this requires rinsing with boiled/cooled water or accepting minor sulfite carryover into your mead.

What to sanitize: everything that touches mead post-mixing. Primary fermenter, secondary carboy, all racking equipment (siphon, tubing, racking cane), hydrometers and test jars, stirring spoons, airlocks and bungs, bottles, and corks (quick soak). Your hands should be clean and rinsed.

For carboys and fermenters, spray or swirl sanitizer to coat all interior surfaces. For tubing, run sanitizer through it. For airlocks and small parts, soak for at least 30 seconds. For bottles, use a bottle rinser attachment or fill/shake/dump.

One infection can ruin months of aging. Sanitize thoroughly, work quickly once equipment is sanitized, and never skip this step no matter how rushed you feel.

      title: "Making Your First Traditional Mead",
      content: `
Let's walk through creating a 5-gallon batch of traditional mead step-by-step. This recipe targets semi-sweet mead around 12-13% ABV.

**Recipe:**
- 15 lbs wildflower or clover honey (target OG ~1.100)
- 4 gallons spring water (adjustable)
- 1 packet Lalvin 71B-1122 yeast
- Yeast nutrients (Fermaid-O or Fermaid-K, following package directions)
- 1.25g Go-Ferm rehydration nutrient

**Before You Start Checklist:**
- All equipment cleaned and ready to sanitize
- Honey at room temperature (cold honey doesn't mix well)
- Yeast and nutrients on hand
- Hydrometer calibrated and ready
- Plan for temperature-stable fermentation location (65-75°F)
- Set aside 4 hours for brew day

**Step-by-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Sanitize Everything**
Mix Star San solution (1 oz per 5 gallons water). Sanitize your primary fermenter, airlock, bung, hydrometer, test jar, thermometer, stirring spoon, and auto-siphon. Keep sanitizer on hand throughout the process.

**Step 2: Warm Water (Optional)**
Heat 1-2 gallons of water to 100-110°F—warm enough to help honey dissolve but not hot enough to drive off delicate honey aromatics or kill yeast. Some meadmakers use room temperature water (no-heat method). Both work; warm water is faster.

**Step 3: Add Honey and Mix**
Pour warm water into sanitized primary fermenter. Add all 15 pounds of honey. Stir vigorously for 5-10 minutes until completely dissolved. This is your "must." Honey is dense and takes time to incorporate—be patient and thorough.

**Step 4: Top Up to Target Volume**
Add more water (room temperature or cool) to bring total volume to 5 gallons. Leave some headspace (don't fill to the brim).

**Step 5: Take Original Gravity Reading**
Pull a sample with your sanitized hydrometer and test jar. Record the Original Gravity (OG). For 15 lbs honey in 5 gallons, expect OG around 1.095-1.105. This determines potential alcohol and final sweetness. Write it down—you'll reference this number for months.

**Step 6: Aerate the Must**
Honey-water has very little dissolved oxygen, which yeast need for cell reproduction. Stir vigorously for 5 minutes, splash, or shake the fermenter (if sealed). Alternatively, use an aquarium pump with sanitized stone for 30-60 minutes. This is your only opportunity to add oxygen—never aerate after fermentation begins.

**Step 7: Cool to Pitching Temperature**
If your must is warm, cool it to yeast's preferred range (typically 65-75°F for 71B, check your specific yeast). Use an ice bath if needed, or wait for it to cool naturally.

**Step 8: Rehydrate Yeast with Go-Ferm**
While must cools, prepare yeast. Heat 50ml (about ¼ cup) water to 110°F. Add 1.25g Go-Ferm, stir to dissolve. Add yeast packet, stir gently, let sit 15-20 minutes until foamy. This gives yeast a nutrient-rich start.

**Step 9: Pitch Yeast**
Pour rehydrated yeast into the must. Stir gently to distribute.

**Step 10: Add First Nutrient Addition**
Add ¼ of your total planned nutrient dose. For Fermaid-O, this might be 2-3g. Stir gently.

**Step 11: Seal with Airlock**
Install sanitized bung and airlock. Fill airlock halfway with sanitizer or vodka. Place fermenter in temperature-stable location away from direct sunlight.

**Step 12: Daily Degassing and Nutrient Additions**
For the first week, follow your nutrient schedule:
- Day 2 (24 hours after pitch): Degas by stirring vigorously for 1 minute. Add second nutrient addition (¼ total dose).
- Day 4: Degas and add third addition.
- Day 7 or at 1/3 sugar break (gravity dropped by ⅓): Degas and add final addition.

Degassing releases trapped CO2, which inhibits yeast activity. This step is critical for healthy fermentation.

**Fermentation Timeline:**
- Days 1-3: Lag phase, minimal activity
- Days 3-10: Vigorous fermentation, bubbling airlock, foam
- Days 10-21: Slowing fermentation, less bubbling
- Days 21-42: Fermentation completes, airlock activity stops

When gravity is stable for 3+ days, fermentation is complete. For semi-sweet mead, expect Final Gravity around 1.010-1.020.

      id: "fermentation-nutrients",
      title: "Fermentation & Nutrient Schedule",
      content: `
Mead fermentation differs from beer and wine in pace and nutrient requirements. Understanding the timeline and nutrient protocol ensures healthy fermentation.

**Primary Fermentation Timeline:**

Most meads complete primary fermentation in 2-6 weeks, though high-gravity sack meads may take 8-12 weeks. The timeline depends on starting gravity, yeast health, nutrients, and temperature.

**Week 1: The Critical Phase**
This is when most nutrient additions happen. Yeast are reproducing, building population, and beginning to consume sugar. You'll see minimal airlock activity days 1-3 (lag phase), then vigorous bubbling starting day 3-5. Foam (krausen) may form. Follow your nutrient schedule religiously this week.

**Week 2: Vigorous Fermentation**
Peak activity. The airlock bubbles constantly. Must may foam and swirl. Gravity drops rapidly—potentially 0.010-0.020 points per day. Temperature may rise 5-10°F above ambient due to exothermic fermentation. Monitor temperature; if it exceeds yeast's ideal range, cool it down (fermentation chamber, wet t-shirt method, or cooler location).

**Weeks 3-4: Slowing Down**
Bubbling slows. Gravity drops decelerate. Mead begins clearing as yeast flocculates (settles). Take gravity readings every few days. When gravity is stable for 3 days (same reading 3 days in a row), primary fermentation is complete.

**Weeks 5-8: Tail End**
High-gravity meads may continue fermenting slowly. Patience is key. As long as gravity is still dropping, fermentation continues. Only when gravity stabilizes is it truly done.

**Staggered Nutrient Additions (SNA) - Detailed Schedule:**

The industry-standard approach to mead nutrients. Divide your total nutrient dose into 3-4 additions spread across early fermentation.

**Calculating Total Nutrient Dose:**
- For Fermaid-O: 2-4g per gallon depending on starting gravity
  - Low gravity (OG 1.060-1.090): 2g/gallon
  - Medium gravity (OG 1.090-1.120): 3g/gallon
  - High gravity (OG 1.120+): 4g/gallon
- For Fermaid-K: 1-2g per gallon (it's stronger)

Example: 5-gallon mead at OG 1.100 = 15g Fermaid-O total

**Addition Schedule:**
- **Day 1 (Pitch)**: Go-Ferm during rehydration (not part of SNA)
- **Day 2 (24 hours post-pitch)**: Add 25% of total (3.75g for our example)
- **Day 4**: Add 25% (3.75g)
- **Day 7 OR at 1/3 sugar break**: Add 25% (3.75g)
- **Day 10 OR at 2/3 sugar break**: Add final 25% (3.75g)

**What is "Sugar Break"?**
The 1/3 sugar break is when gravity has dropped by ⅓ of the way from OG to expected FG. For OG 1.100 expecting to finish at 1.010 (90-point drop), the 1/3 break is at 1.070 (30 points dropped). Check gravity daily to catch these points.

**Why Degassing Matters:**

CO2 produced during fermentation dissolves into the mead. High CO2 levels stress yeast and slow fermentation. Degassing releases this CO2.

How to degas: Remove airlock, stir vigorously for 30-60 seconds with sanitized spoon, or use a drill-mounted degassing wand. You'll see CO2 bubbles rise. Do this daily during the first week, then every few days until fermentation slows.

**Temperature Control:**

Most wine yeasts perform best at 60-75°F. Too cold (below 55°F) and fermentation slows or stalls. Too hot (above 80°F) and yeast produce fusel alcohols (harsh, hot, solvent-like) and excessive esters.

Ideal temperatures by yeast:
- 71B: 59-86°F (optimal 62-68°F)
- D47: 59-68°F (very temperature-sensitive)
- K1-V1116: 50-95°F (wide range, very flexible)
- EC-1118: 50-86°F (ferments well cool)

Maintain stable temperature. A basement (naturally 62-68°F) is perfect. Avoid locations with wide day/night temperature swings.

**Signs of Healthy Fermentation:**
- Airlock bubbles regularly (frequency varies)
- Gravity steadily decreases
- Pleasant yeasty/honey aroma
- Foam or swirling in fermenter
- Mead gradually clears as yeast settles

**Concerning Signs:**
- No activity after 72 hours: Check temperature, verify yeast viability, consider re-pitching
- Foul sulfur smell (rotten eggs): Stressed yeast, likely nutrient deficiency—add nutrients and degas
- Vinegar smell: Acetobacter infection, likely unrecoverable
- Stuck fermentation (gravity stable way above target): Insufficient nutrients, temperature too low, or yeast reached tolerance

      id: "secondary-aging",
      title: "Secondary & Aging",
      content: `
Mead is not ready when fermentation finishes. In fact, young mead (< 3 months) often tastes harsh, hot, or medicinal—nothing like the smooth, complex beverage it will become. Aging is where mead transforms from rough alcohol into liquid gold.

**Racking to Secondary:**

When primary fermentation completes (stable gravity for 3+ days), rack your mead off the yeast sediment (lees) into a sanitized secondary fermenter (carboy). Leaving mead on thick lees for months can create off-flavors as dead yeast cells decompose (autolysis).

How to rack: Use an auto-siphon and tubing. Place primary fermenter on a counter, secondary carboy on the floor below. Insert racking cane, keeping the tip above the sediment layer. Start siphon and let gravity do the work. Minimize splashing and oxygen exposure.

**Top Up or Accept Headspace:**
Oxygen is mead's enemy during aging. In secondary, minimize headspace (air between mead and bung). Options:
- Top up with similar mead, boiled/cooled water, or sanitized marbles
- Use a smaller carboy that fits your volume better
- Accept minimal headspace (1-2 inches is okay for a few months)
- Purge headspace with CO2 from a tank (advanced technique)

Install a sanitized airlock. Move to a cool, dark, stable location (basement ideal).

**Bulk Aging: Where Magic Happens:**

Bulk aging (aging in carboys before bottling) offers numerous advantages:
- Mead matures uniformly in one large vessel
- You can taste and adjust (sweeten, add tannin, adjust acid)
- Sediment drops in the carboy, not in bottles
- Easier to monitor clarity and stability
- Psychological: you're not tempted to drink it too young

What happens during aging? Harsh alcohols mellow. Flavors integrate and round out. Esters develop complexity. Fusel alcohols (hot, solvent-like) convert to softer compounds. Phenolic harshness softens. The result is smooth, balanced, delicious mead.

**Minimum Aging Times by Style:**

These are minimums—mead almost always improves beyond these timeframes.

- **Hydromel (session mead)**: 2-3 months total. Lower alcohol finishes faster. Drinkable young.
- **Standard Traditional Mead**: 6-12 months. Six months is drinkable; twelve months is notably better.
- **Melomel (fruit mead)**: 6-12 months. Fruit character softens and integrates over time.
- **Metheglin (spiced)**: 4-8 months. Spices mellow and blend with honey.
- **Cyser**: 4-8 months. Apple character softens quickly.
- **Sack Mead (high-alcohol dessert mead)**: 12-24+ months minimum. High-gravity meads need extensive aging. Two years is often better than one. Some improve for 5-10 years.

**Temperature for Aging:**
Cool and stable is ideal—55-65°F. Basement, wine fridge, or cool closet. Avoid temperature swings and direct sunlight. Higher temperatures accelerate aging but may create off-flavors; cooler temps slow aging but produce cleaner results.

**Multiple Rackings for Clarity:**

As mead ages, sediment continues dropping. Rack every 2-4 months for the first year to get mead off accumulating lees. Each racking improves clarity. Eventually (often 6-12 months), sediment becomes minimal and racking frequency decreases.

Typical schedule:
- Rack #1: End of primary to secondary (month 1-2)
- Rack #2: 3-4 months in
- Rack #3: 6-8 months in
- Rack #4: 10-12 months if needed

**Patience Is Not Optional:**

Mead rewards patience like no other fermented beverage. The urge to bottle and drink young mead is strong—resist it. Mead at 3 months tastes wildly different (often worse) than the same mead at 9 months. Write the start date on your carboy and commit to the minimum aging time. Start multiple batches at staggered intervals so there's always mead approaching readiness while new batches age.

Crystal-clear mead isn't just aesthetically pleasing—it indicates proper aging, complete fermentation, and stability. Most mead clarifies naturally with time, but you can accelerate the process or address stubborn haze.

**Natural Clarification:**

Time is the best clarifier. Given 6-12 months, nearly all mead becomes brilliantly clear as yeast, proteins, and particulates slowly settle via gravity. Each racking removes sediment layers. Cool temperatures (55-60°F) encourage faster settling. Patience often eliminates the need for fining agents entirely.

**When to Consider Fining Agents:**

If mead remains hazy after 6+ months, or if you need to bottle sooner than ideal, fining agents help. Test a small sample first to verify the fining agent works for your specific haze type.

**Bentonite**: Clay that removes protein haze (common in mead). Mix with hot water to create slurry, add to mead, wait 1-2 weeks. Very effective but can strip some body and flavor if overused.

**Sparkolloid**: Hot-mix polysaccharide. Excellent for mead clarity. Boil with water, cool, add to mead, wait 1-2 weeks. Produces compact sediment easy to rack off.

**Super-Kleer (Kieselsol/Chitosan)**: Two-part system. Add kieselsol, wait 30 minutes, add chitosan. Within 24-48 hours, mead is crystal clear. Minimal flavor impact. Popular for quick results.

**Isinglass**: Fish-derived gelatin. Gentle and effective for light haze. Add per package directions, wait 1 week.

**Pectic Enzyme**: If you suspect pectin haze (from fruit additions), add pectic enzyme and wait several weeks. Pectin haze looks like persistent cloudiness that doesn't settle.

**Cold Crashing:**

Chilling mead to near-freezing (32-35°F) for 1-2 weeks causes proteins, yeast, and tartrate crystals to precipitate rapidly. Refrigerator, chest freezer with temperature controller, or very cold garage in winter all work. After cold crash, rack off the sediment. This also cold-stabilizes mead, preventing tartrate crystal formation in bottles later.

**Stabilizing Before Back-Sweetening:**

If you plan to add more honey or sugar to a finished dry mead (back-sweetening), you MUST stabilize first. Otherwise, residual yeast will referment the added sugar, creating carbonation or bottle bombs.

Stabilization protocol:
1. Add potassium sorbate (0.5-0.75 tsp per gallon) and stir thoroughly
2. Add one crushed Campden tablet per gallon and stir
3. Wait 24 hours before sweetening

Potassium sorbate prevents yeast reproduction. Campden tablets (sulfites) kill/stun existing yeast. Together, they create a stable environment for sweetness.

Note: If mead is already sweet (fermentation stopped before full attenuation), stabilizing is optional unless you're adding more sugar.

**Filtration (Advanced):**

Serious meadmakers sometimes filter mead through pads or cartridges. Filtration produces brilliant clarity instantly but can strip body and flavor if too aggressive. Use coarse filters (5 micron) for polishing or fine filters (0.5 micron) for sterile filtration before sweetening. Most homebrewers skip this—time and fining agents handle clarity just fine.

      title: "Back-Sweetening (Optional)",
      content: `
Many meads finish drier than desired. Your yeast ate more sugar than expected, or you prefer sweeter mead than the recipe delivered. Back-sweetening adds sweetness to finished mead, putting you in complete control of the final product.

**Why Back-Sweeten?**

Balance and personal preference. Dry mead (FG 0.990-1.000) can taste thin, acidic, or alcoholic. Adding sweetness creates body, rounds out harsh edges, balances acidity, and showcases honey character. Semi-sweet to sweet meads (FG 1.010-1.030) are often more approachable for non-mead drinkers.

**Stabilize First—This Is Non-Negotiable:**

Before adding any sugar to finished mead, you MUST stabilize. Add potassium sorbate (½ tsp per gallon) plus one crushed Campden tablet per gallon, stir well, and wait 24 hours. Skip this and you risk refermentation in bottles—best case carbonated mead you didn't want, worst case bottle bombs exploding and creating a dangerous mess.

**Sweetening Options:**

**Honey**: The traditional choice. Use the same honey variety as the original batch for consistency, or experiment with complementary honeys (add orange blossom honey to a wildflower mead for citrus notes). Warm honey slightly to make it easier to pour. Add incrementally—you can always add more but can't remove sweetness.

**Simple Syrup**: Dissolve white sugar in water (2:1 ratio) by heating gently. Completely neutral sweetness without adding honey character. Useful if you want sweetness without changing the honey profile.

**Fruit Juice/Concentrate**: For melomels, adding more of the same fruit juice can boost both sweetness and fruit character. Stabilize first or the juice will referment.

**Non-Fermentable Sweeteners**: Lactose (milk sugar), erythritol, or xylitol sweeten without risk of refermentation. However, they may create off-flavors or mouthfeel changes. Lactose works well in mead, adding creamy sweetness.

**Process for Back-Sweetening:**

1. Stabilize mead (sorbate + sulfite) and wait 24 hours
2. Pull a measured sample (e.g., 500ml)
3. Add small amounts of honey/sweetener to the sample, stirring and tasting after each addition
4. Keep notes on how much you added to the sample
5. When sample tastes perfect, calculate the ratio and scale up to your full batch
6. Add sweetener to full batch, stir thoroughly
7. Let sit for a few days, taste again—sometimes perception changes as sweetness integrates
8. Adjust if needed, then bottle

**How Much to Add?**

There's no universal answer—it depends on starting dryness, desired sweetness, and personal taste. Guidelines:
- Light sweetening: 2-4 oz honey per gallon (raises gravity ~0.004-0.008)
- Medium sweetness: 4-8 oz honey per gallon (raises gravity ~0.008-0.016)
- Sweet/dessert: 8-16 oz honey per gallon (raises gravity ~0.016-0.032)

Always start conservative. Add a little, taste, wait a day, and repeat until perfect.

**Balancing Sweetness and Acidity:**

Sweet mead can taste cloying without adequate acidity. If back-sweetened mead tastes flat or syrupy, add acid blend (tartaric/malic/citric acid mix) in tiny increments (⅛ tsp per gallon) until brightness returns. Conversely, if mead is too tart, sweetness balances the acidity. The interplay of sweet and acid creates complexity and drinkability.

**Patience After Sweetening:**

Let mead sit for at least a week after back-sweetening before bottling. This allows sweetness to integrate and lets you verify no refermentation is occurring (check gravity is still stable). If gravity starts dropping again, you have a problem—stabilization failed, and you need to address it before bottling.

      title: "Bottling",
      content: `
Bottling is the culmination of months of work. Proper bottling technique ensures your mead stays fresh, continues improving, and presents beautifully.

**When Is Mead Ready to Bottle?**

Several criteria must be met:
1. **Fermentation complete**: Gravity stable for at least 2 weeks (same reading multiple days)
2. **Clarity**: Should be clear enough to read through (hold bottle up to light)
3. **Taste balanced**: No harsh green flavors, overly hot alcohol, or unpleasant off-flavors
4. **Minimum age met**: At least the minimum for your style (6 months for standard mead, 12+ for sack)
5. **No visible sediment dropping**: If sediment is still settling, wait longer or rack again

Most mead is bottled 6-18 months after starting. Rushing this leads to disappointment.

**Still vs Sparkling Mead:**

**Still Mead** (no carbonation) is traditional and most common. Bottle like wine—use corks or screw caps, standard 750ml wine bottles.

**Sparkling Mead** (carbonated) requires bottle conditioning (adding priming sugar and live yeast) or forced carbonation (kegging with CO2). Sparkling mead MUST use champagne bottles rated for pressure—standard wine bottles will explode. This is an advanced technique beyond the scope of a first mead. If you want sparkling mead, research proper methods carefully.

**Bottle Preparation:**

Clean and sanitize all bottles. Inspect for cracks or chips—damaged bottles can fail. Rinse thoroughly with hot water. Sanitize with Star San (spray or soak), then drain upside-down on bottle tree or clean towel.

**Cork vs Cap:**

**Natural Cork**: Traditional, elegant, allows tiny oxygen exchange (good for aging wines). Requires bottles designed for cork (standard wine bottles). Soak corks in sanitizer for 5-10 minutes before use. Natural corks work for 5-10+ years but can dry out or crumble if stored upright.

**Synthetic Cork/Nomacorc**: Consistent seal, no cork taint, doesn't dry out. Slightly less romantic but highly practical. No soaking needed—just sanitize briefly.

**Screw Caps**: Require specific bottles with the right neck finish. Excellent seal, easy to open, modern. Some meadmakers love them; others prefer cork's tradition.

**Beer Caps**: Work for mead if you're using beer bottles. Simpler than corking. Fine for mead you'll drink within a year or two.

**Filling Bottles:**

Use a bottle filler (spring-loaded wand) attached to your auto-siphon. Place bottling bucket on counter, bottles on floor. Insert wand to bottle bottom, press to fill. Fill to appropriate headspace (~1 inch from cork insertion point for wine bottles). Work steadily—minimize air exposure.

**Corking:**

A floor corker makes this easy. Insert sanitized cork into the compression chamber, position over filled bottle, pull lever. Cork compresses and inserts perfectly. Hand corkers work but require significant strength and produce inconsistent results.

**Labeling:**

Always label bottles with at least:
- Mead type (Traditional Mead, Blackberry Melomel, etc.)
- Batch date or bottling date
- ABV% (optional but useful)

Handwritten labels, printed labels, or fancy custom labels all work. You will forget what's what without labels—trust this wisdom.

**Bottle Aging:**

Mead continues improving in bottles. Even if your mead tasted great at bottling, it will taste better in 3-6 months. "Bottle shock" (stress from bottling) can temporarily mute flavors—wait 2-4 weeks before judging.

Store bottles:
- **Upright** for synthetic corks or caps
- **On their side** for natural corks (keeps cork moist)
- **Cool location** (55-65°F ideal)
- **Dark** (light damages mead over time)
- **Stable temperature** (avoid garages with huge temp swings)

**How Long Does Mead Keep?**

Properly made and stored mead improves for years. Standard meads peak at 1-3 years. Sack meads peak at 3-10 years. I've tasted 20-year-old mead that was transcendent. Unlike beer (drink fresh), mead is wine—it ages beautifully.

      id: "melomels",
      title: "Making Melomels (Fruit Meads)",
      content: `
Melomels—meads made with fruit—are spectacularly popular for good reason. Fruit adds complexity, color, acidity, and approachability. A well-made melomel rivals the best fruit wines and often exceeds them in character.

**When to Add Fruit: Primary vs Secondary**

Two schools of thought exist:

**Primary Fruit Addition**: Add fruit at the start with honey and water. Fruit ferments alongside honey. Benefits: Fruit sugars contribute to alcohol, fruit character integrates deeply, fermentation is vigorous. Drawbacks: Difficult to control fruit intensity, fermentation blows off delicate aromatics, creates more sediment.

**Secondary Fruit Addition**: Add fruit after primary fermentation completes. Benefits: Preserves delicate fruit aromatics, easier to control fruit intensity by tasting and adjusting, cleaner fermentation. Drawbacks: Adds fermentation time (fruit sugars will ferment), more racking steps, risk of oxidation when opening fermenter.

Most meadmakers prefer secondary addition for quality control and aroma preservation, especially with delicate fruits (raspberry, strawberry). Robust fruits (blackberry, blueberry) work well in primary.

**How Much Fruit?**

General guidelines per gallon of mead:
- **Berries** (raspberry, blackberry, blueberry, strawberry): 2-4 lbs per gallon
- **Stone fruits** (cherry, peach, plum): 2-3 lbs per gallon
- **Citrus**: Use zest and juice sparingly—¼-½ lb per gallon (citrus is potent)
- **Tropical fruits** (mango, pineapple, passion fruit): 1-3 lbs per gallon
- **Apples**: Use juice to replace water (this becomes cyser)

More fruit = stronger fruit character. Start conservative—you can always add more in another batch.

**Popular Fruit Combinations:**

- **Blackberry Melomel**: Robust, jammy, deep purple. Use 3-4 lbs/gallon. Pairs with clover or wildflower honey.
- **Raspberry Melomel**: Bright, tart, aromatic. Use 3 lbs/gallon in secondary to preserve aroma. Exceptional with orange blossom honey.
- **Blueberry Melomel**: Subtle, smooth, blue-purple color. Use 3-4 lbs/gallon. Great beginner melomel.
- **Cherry Melomel**: Complex, tart, almond notes from pits. Tart cherries (Montmorency) recommended, 2-3 lbs/gallon.
- **Peach Melomel**: Delicate, summery, stone fruit character. Use 2-3 lbs/gallon in secondary. Wildflower honey complements.
- **Strawberry Melomel**: Surprisingly subtle—strawberry flavor fades in fermentation. Use 4+ lbs/gallon for noticeable character.

**Fruit Preparation:**

**Fresh Fruit**: Wash, remove stems/pits/seeds. Chop or crush. Freeze for 24-48 hours (breaks cell walls, improves juice extraction). Thaw and add to mead.

**Frozen Fruit**: Often better than fresh—already frozen (cell walls broken), available year-round, consistent quality. Thaw and add.

**Fruit Puree**: Aseptic purees (e.g., Oregon Fruit Purees, Vintner's Harvest) are pre-pasteurized. Very convenient, consistent, no prep. Pour directly into mead.

**Dried Fruit**: Rehydrate in warm water, then add. Use less than fresh (concentrated flavor)—1 lb dried ≈ 3 lbs fresh.

**Process for Secondary Fruit Addition:**

1. Ferment honey-water to completion (stable gravity)
2. Rack to secondary carboy
3. Add prepared fruit directly to carboy or use mesh bag (easier fruit removal)
4. Seal with airlock
5. Fermentation restarts as yeast consume fruit sugars (1-3 weeks)
6. Once stable again, rack off fruit into clean carboy
7. Age, then bottle

Fruit will float initially, then sink as fermentation progresses. Mesh bags make removal cleaner but can trap fruit flavor—leaving fruit loose extracts more but creates more sediment.

**Balancing Fruit and Honey:**

Taste throughout the process. If fruit dominates and honey is lost, you've added too much fruit (adjust recipe next time). If fruit barely registers, add more or extend contact time. The goal is harmonious balance where both honey and fruit shine.

**Acidity Adjustment:**

Fruit adds acidity, which is often exactly what mead needs. However, some fruits (blueberry) are low-acid. Taste your melomel—if it's flabby or sweet-cloying, add acid blend (¼ tsp per gallon, taste, repeat). If it's puckering-tart, back-sweeten with honey to balance.

      id: "troubleshooting",
      title: "Troubleshooting Mead",
      content: `
Even experienced meadmakers encounter problems. Knowing how to diagnose and fix issues saves batches and sanity.

**Stuck Fermentation:**

Symptom: Gravity stops dropping well above target final gravity. Airlock activity ceases. Mead is still sweet when it should be dry.

Causes:
- **Insufficient nutrients** (most common): Honey lacks nutrients; without additions, yeast starve
- **Temperature too cold**: Below 60°F, most yeast go dormant
- **Yeast reached alcohol tolerance**: You exceeded the strain's limit
- **pH too low or too high**: Yeast struggle outside 3.0-4.0 pH range

Solutions:
1. Warm mead to 68-72°F
2. Add yeast nutrient (Fermaid-O or Fermaid-K) and energizer
3. Degas vigorously to release CO2
4. Gently swirl or rock fermenter to rouse yeast
5. Wait 3-5 days; check if gravity drops
6. If still stuck, make a starter with high-alcohol-tolerant yeast (EC-1118), get it fermenting vigorously, then add small amounts of stuck mead gradually to acclimate the new yeast

**Slow Fermentation:**

Symptom: Fermentation progresses but very slowly—takes 8-12+ weeks to finish.

Causes: Usually nutrient deficiency or cool temperature.

Solutions: Add nutrients, warm slightly, degas regularly, and be patient. Slow fermentation isn't ideal but still produces drinkable mead.

**Hydrogen Sulfide (Rotten Egg Smell):**

Symptom: Foul sulfur/rotten egg smell during or shortly after fermentation.

Causes:
- Stressed yeast from insufficient nutrients (very common)
- Yeast sitting on lees too long
- Certain yeast strains prone to H2S production

Solutions:
1. Rack immediately off the lees
2. Add yeast nutrient
3. Degas vigorously (drives off some H2S)
4. Splash-rack (aerate gently) to oxidize sulfur compounds
5. Copper treatment: Drop sanitized copper pennies (pre-1982) or copper pipe into mead for 24 hours—copper binds sulfur
6. Time: mild H2S often dissipates with aging

If caught early, mead usually recovers completely.

**Hot Alcohol / Fusel Alcohols:**

Symptom: Harsh, burning, solvent-like alcohol flavor. Mead tastes "rocket fuel."

Causes:
- Fermentation temperature too high (above 78-80°F)
- Stressed yeast
- Insufficient aging

Solutions:
- Prevent: Control fermentation temperature strictly
- Fix: Time. Fusel alcohols mellow significantly with 6-12 months aging. A harsh young mead often becomes smooth with patience.

**Medicinal or Phenolic Flavors:**

Symptom: Band-aid, medicinal, plastic, or smoky off-flavors.

Causes:
- Chlorine or chloramine in water
- Wild yeast contamination
- Excessive temperature swings

Solutions:
- Prevent: Use spring water or treat tap water with Campden tablets before brewing
- Fix: Some phenolic flavors fade with aging; others are permanent. Blending with clean mead may salvage it.

**Mead Too Sweet:**

If mead finished much sweeter than desired:
- Yeast reached alcohol tolerance early
- Insufficient nutrients caused stuck fermentation
- Wrong yeast choice for target dryness

Solutions:
- Restart fermentation with high-tolerance yeast (EC-1118)
- Blend with drier mead to balance
- Accept it and enjoy semi-sweet mead
- Back-blend with acid to balance sweetness

**Mead Too Dry:**

If mead fermented completely dry and tastes thin/acidic:
- Stabilize with sorbate + sulfite
- Back-sweeten with honey to desired level
- Add glycerin for body without sweetness

**Won't Clear / Persistent Haze:**

Causes:
- Pectin haze (from fruit)
- Protein haze
- Starch haze (rare in mead)
- Yeast suspension

Solutions:
- Time: most haze clears in 6-12 months
- Cold crash (33-35°F for 2 weeks)
- Fining agents: Try Super-Kleer first (fast, effective)
- Pectic enzyme if fruit was used
- Bentonite for protein haze

**Vinegar Smell / Sour Taste:**

Symptom: Sharp acetic acid smell, sour/vinegar taste.

Cause: Acetobacter infection—bacteria that convert alcohol to acetic acid in presence of oxygen.

Solutions: Unfortunately, this is nearly impossible to reverse. Prevent by minimizing oxygen exposure and maintaining sanitation. Infected mead is usually a loss (or can be distilled into vinegar for cooking).

**Prevent Problems:**

Most issues trace back to three root causes:
1. **Insufficient nutrients**: Follow SNA protocol religiously
2. **Poor temperature control**: Maintain 65-75°F throughout fermentation
3. **Inadequate sanitation**: Sanitize everything, work clean

Master these three, and 90% of problems never occur.

      title: "Glossary of Mead Terms",
      content: `
**Mead**: Fermented honey beverage. The oldest alcoholic drink known to humanity.

**Must**: The mixture of honey, water, and any additives before and during fermentation. Once fermented, it becomes mead.

**Melomel**: Mead made with fruit. One of the most popular mead styles.

**Metheglin**: Mead made with spices or herbs (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, etc.).

**Cyser**: Mead made with apple juice/cider instead of water.

**Pyment**: Mead made with grape juice. Essentially honey-sweetened wine.

**Braggot**: Hybrid of mead and beer, containing both honey and malted grain.

**Bochet**: Mead made with caramelized honey, producing deep toffee and caramel flavors.

**Hydromel**: Low-alcohol session mead (typically 3.5-7.5% ABV). "Hydro" = water, "mel" = honey.

**Sack Mead**: High-alcohol, sweet dessert mead (14-20%+ ABV). Rich and decadent.

**Show Mead**: Another term for traditional mead—honey, water, yeast only. "Show" refers to showing off the honey's character.

**OG (Original Gravity)**: Starting specific gravity measurement before fermentation. Indicates potential alcohol.

**FG (Final Gravity)**: Gravity after fermentation completes. Indicates residual sweetness and actual alcohol.

**ABV (Alcohol By Volume)**: Percentage of alcohol in finished mead, calculated from OG and FG.

**SNA (Staggered Nutrient Additions)**: Protocol for adding yeast nutrients in stages throughout early fermentation rather than all at once.

**TOSNA**: Tailored Organic Staggered Nutrient Additions—advanced nutrient protocol using only organic nutrients, no DAP.

**DAP**: Diammonium Phosphate—inorganic nitrogen source for yeast. Fast-acting but can create harsh character if overused.

**Fermaid-O**: Organic yeast nutrient blend (autolyzed yeast, vitamins). Gentle and effective.

**Fermaid-K**: Inorganic nutrient blend with DAP, vitamins, and minerals. Powerful but requires careful dosing.

**Go-Ferm**: Rehydration nutrient mixed with water when rehydrating dry yeast. Prepares yeast for fermentation stress.

**Degassing**: Removing dissolved CO2 from fermenting mead by stirring. CO2 inhibits yeast activity.

**Lees**: Sediment of dead yeast cells, proteins, and particulates that settle at bottom of fermenter.

**Racking**: Transferring mead from one vessel to another using a siphon, leaving sediment behind.

**Autolysis**: Decomposition of dead yeast cells. Can create off-flavors if mead sits on thick lees too long.

**Back-Sweetening**: Adding honey or sugar to finished mead to increase sweetness after fermentation.

**Stabilizing**: Adding potassium sorbate and sulfites to prevent renewed fermentation, required before back-sweetening.

**Fining**: Adding agents (bentonite, Sparkolloid, Super-Kleer) to clarify mead by causing haze particles to settle.

**Cold Crash**: Chilling mead to near-freezing to rapidly drop sediment and clarify.

**Stuck Fermentation**: Fermentation that stops prematurely, leaving mead sweeter than intended.

**Fusel Alcohols**: Higher alcohols produced by stressed yeast or high-temp fermentation. Taste hot, harsh, solvent-like. Mellow with aging.

**Sulfites**: Potassium or sodium metabisulfite. Kills wild yeast, prevents oxidation, stabilizes mead.

**Campden Tablets**: Measured sulfite tablets. One tablet per gallon is standard dose.

**Potassium Sorbate**: Chemical that prevents yeast reproduction. Used with sulfites for stabilization.

**Session Mead**: Another term for hydromel—low-alcohol mead for casual drinking.

**Semi-Sweet**: Mead with noticeable sweetness but not dessert-level. FG typically 1.010-1.020.

**Dry**: Mead with little to no residual sweetness. FG typically 0.990-1.005.

**Sweet**: Mead with significant sweetness. FG typically 1.020-1.040+.
